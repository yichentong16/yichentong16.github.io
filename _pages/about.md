Hello! I am Yichen. I am a PhD Candidate in Mathematics at [RPTU](https://math.rptu.de/en/home), working under the supervision of [Prof. Claus Fieker](https://math.rptu.de/ags/agag/personen/leitung/fieker). My research interest lies in the area of computational number theory.

I obtained my master's degree in Mathematics from the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.math.cit.tum.de/en/math/home/). My master's thesis on _"Arithmetic on hyperelliptic Jacobians and singular curves"_ was supervised by [Prof. Lorenz Panny](https://yx7.cc/).
